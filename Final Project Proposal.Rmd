Project Title
-------------
Analyzing EEG Signals to predict the motor-sensory actions and their relations to Schezophrenia & other Neural Diseases

Type of Final Project
---------------------
Project Type I - Analysis of EEG Signals

Based on the EEG signal data available for various subjects, we will be focussing our analysis to find the difference in motor-sensory activities in healthy subjects to that of patients suffering from Schezophrenia. From the EEG signals so available we can eventually also predict the chances of Epilepsy, chances of Alzheimer, drying and damage of Neurons and so on and so forth.  Finally all these analysis would help us to visualize, summarize, predict, and understand the underlying relationships between the EEG signals with various motor-activities such as (hand movement & leg movement, respond to external stimuli by virtue of speaking, facial expression etc) that could eventually form the basis for building medical devices for patients with these neurological disabilities and thereby empowering these patients with the ability to move through the world with greater autonomy.


Executive Summary of the Proposed Project
-----------------------------------------
Neurological disorders are diseases of the brain, spine and the nerves that connect them. In recognizing the signs and symptoms of neurological problems, it is first important to distinguish the various types of neurological disorders. And in most cases EEG (Electroencephalography) is the diagnostic procedure followed universally to understand and classify the numerous kinds of neurological disorders.

Schizophrenia is one of the neurological disorders that affects about 1% of people across the globe. One possible explanation for some of the symptoms of schizophrenia is that one or more problems with the corollary discharge process in the nervous system makes it difficult for patients to differentiate between internally and externally generated stimuli. As for example, during talking, patients with schizophrenia show less evidence of pretalking activity and less suppression of the speech sound, consistent with dysfunction of efference copy and corollary discharge, respectively.Therefore, studying this process and its relationship to symptoms in the illness might allow us to better understand abnormal brain processes in patients with this diagnosis.

In a previously published EEG experiment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4059422/) the following conditions were assesed, where a simple button pressing task in which subjects either (1) pressed a button to immediately generated a tone, (2) passively listened to the same tone, or (3) pressed a button without generating a tone to study the corollary discharge in people with schizophrenia and comparison controls. It was found that comparison controls suppressed the N100, a negative deflection in EEG brain wave 100 milliseconds after the onset of a sound, when they pressed a button to generate a tone compared to passive playback, but patients with schizophrenia did not.

Epilepsy is another neurological disorders that affects the normal functioning of the brain's nerve cell activities, that might eventually lead to seizures. These abnormal brain activities can be also traced in EEG signals and can help to identify the detection of epileptic seizures.   

We might have to use some Algorithms, Sampling Techniques, Classifiers, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), ANOVA, Logistic Models, and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to extract and identify some of the key characteristic features of EEG signals to differentiate between healthy subjects and patients with neurological disorders.

We might start our Project with R and eventually use both R & Python depending on the complexity of the project situtaion as we dive deep into analyzing the data sets. 


Data Needs and Sources
-----------------------
We are going to use the following datasets from Kaggle:

Anticipated Challenges: 

While building model and data gathering for the purpose of predicting Epilepsy we might need to have some domain knowledge on how to prepare and build the model to read and interpret the EEG signals. Similarly we might face challenges while trying to identify and diagnose other Neurological disorders by decoding the EEG signals.  

Sources: 
These are some of the articles that we might refer to while trying to predict other Neurological disorders by deciphering the EEG signals.

Personal Learning Objectives
----------------------------
We aim to enhance our skills in terms of predictive, descriptive, and prescriptive analytics. We also wish to learn more about building various Linear & Non-Linear Models in R & Python to build significant Predictive Models. We would like to explore and learn more about the various library functions available with both R and Python.
